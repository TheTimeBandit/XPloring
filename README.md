# XPloring

### Interactive Text Adventure Game

User (player) types text commands to control the character and interact with the game world.

Start the game by executing [Launcher.py](https://github.com/TheTimeBandit/XPloring/blob/master/Launcher.py)

This project is made of two main parts:
- <b>Interpreter</b> - reads game files and handles logic
- <b>Game files</b> - contain state of the game (rooms, monsters, item placement, player stats and equipment ...)

Currently, there are two simple straight-forward tutorials:
- [Arena Escape](https://github.com/TheTimeBandit/XPloring/blob/master/game_states/arena_escape.json)
- [Cake Problem](https://github.com/TheTimeBandit/XPloring/blob/master/game_states/cake_problem.json)

There is currently one game file with complex storyline:
- [The Cave of Awakening](https://github.com/TheTimeBandit/XPloring/blob/master/game_states/cave-of-awakening.json)

Other game files are used for testing purposes and are not meant to provide a satisfying experience of an adventure and should be ignored
